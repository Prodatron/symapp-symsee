<b>INTRODUCTION TO SYMSEE</b><br>
<br>
SymSee is a picture viewer for SymbOS, which allows you to watch your image libraries in a comfortable way. You can step through your gallery with one mouse or keyboard click for each picture.<br>
<br>
Pictures can be viewed in window or fullscreen mode. SymbOS SGX files of any resolutions in 4 or 16 colours, raw 16K CPC files and OCP Art Studio (compressed or uncompressed) screens and are supported. Additionally SymSee supports a slide show feature, where the pictures will change automatically after a special time. A random order is possible as well.<br>
<br>
320x200 (CPC, EP) and 512x212 (MSX, PCW; 4 or 16 colours) standard SymbOS SGX files can be used as desktop background pictures directly in SymSee.<br>
